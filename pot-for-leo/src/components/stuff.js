            Hello and welcome! Katie here, your friendly neighborhood Ethical
            Hacker and Blockchain Developer. Over the past 4 years, I've
            journeyed through the tech landscape, exploring web development,
            android development, and trying my hands in languages eg. Python,
            Java, C++, C, php, Ruby and their frameworks. However, my heart
            truly found its home in Cybersecurity, a passion I've dedicated the
            last 2 years to honing.
            <br />
            I thrive on challenges, love participating in CTFs and enjoy
            learning new tricks. When I'm not immersed in ones and zeroes,
            you'll find me immersed in the pages of a thrilling novel or
            binge-watching the latest marvel movies or anime series. From
            magical realms (mostly) to cyberpunk, I'm as much a fan of
            captivating narratives as I am of impenetrable firewalls.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, whether you're a security-knight, an anime adventurer, or just
            someone curious about the digital world, let's connect, brainstorm,
            or maybe even share anime recommendations. ðŸ“šðŸŽ‰ Feel free to shoot
            me a message on LinkedIn or drop me an email.
          </p>
